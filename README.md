# Land-Cover-Classification-from-VHRSI-using-DL
Land cover (LC) represents the Earth’s surface features, which include water, soil, vegetation, and so on with their respective sub-groups. Accurate and timely LC
information is important for decision-making processes and resource management at various levels. However, LC mapping is often difficult and time-consuming with
the conventional approach. The increased availability of Very High Resolution Satellite Imagery (VHRSI) has given precedent to deep learning (DL) in
supervised LC because of their ability to handle big data and produce more accurate results with a considerable balance between accuracy and computational time.
Among the various models of deep learning, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) stands out as the most emblematic, characterized by its deeper architecture and remarkable learning capacity.
